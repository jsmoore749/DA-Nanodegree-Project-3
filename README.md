# Prosper Loan Data
## by Josh Moore

## Dataset

The Prosper Loan data set contains information about individuals who have received personal loans from Prosper between 2005 and 2014. This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. 

## Summary of Findings

During my exploration of the data set, I found that most of the interest rates fell between .06 to .36. The majority of the borrowers had a job and had incomes between $25,000 and $75,000. 52.9% of the borrowers owned their own home. Prosper typically didn't lend money to borrower's with high Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratios. Most of the loans were for $5000 or less with few loans issued over $15,000.

Based on the dataset, Prosper typically loans money out to borrowers who have low DTI scores and will loan more money to borrowers who have higher incomes. Additionally, Prosper loans more money out at a lower APR.

When it comes to home ownership, the lender is more likely to loan more money to borrowers who own their own house. Borrowers who own their own hom are also more likely to receive a better APR on that loan than a borrower who doesn't own a home. Another correlation is the borrower's loan APR and their credit score. As their credit score increases, their loan APR decreases.

## Key Insights for Presentation

There are 2 variables that I think help illustrate my original investigation of how much a borrower's financial health affects their loan details. Owning your own home and having higher incomes seem to be 2 major factors with loans. I plan to address those details in Part 2.
